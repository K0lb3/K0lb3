I'm a hobby game-data-miner that went from using unitypack to writing my Unity asset unpacker and editor named UnityPy. For this, I also created some additional libraries to support the export and import of more asset types.
Through this, I learned knowledge in various fields, such as binary formats, encryption, compression, textures, networking, and many more.


Irl I'm a computer science student that focuses on data security and network analysis. In the future I will likely publish some useful tools in those two areas, so stay tuned.

__Tools__

- [UnityPy](https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy) - a library for Unity asset extraction and modification
  - [TypetreeGenerator](https://github.com/K0lb3/TypeTreeGenerator) - a tool to generate the typetree structure for Unity MonoBehaviours
  - [etcpak](https://github.com/K0lb3/etcpak) - a library for dxt & etc compression and decompression
  - [astc_decomp](https://github.com/K0lb3/astc_decomp) - a library for astc decompression
  - [tex2img](https://github.com/K0lb3/tex2img) - a library for decompressing various texture formats

- [protobuf_extractor](https://github.com/K0lb3/proto_extractor) - a tool to extract and reconstruct protobuf definitions

__Game Data-Mines__

I moved all of my game datamine projects to [K0lb3's-Datamines](https://github.com/K0lb3s-Datamines).
The only exception to that is [TROUBLESHOOTER: Abandoned Children](https://github.com/K0lb3/TROUBLESHOOTER-mine) [mod-kit](https://github.com/K0lb3/TroubleTool).
