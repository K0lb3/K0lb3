I'm a hobby game-data-miner that went from using unitypack to writing my Unity asset unpacker and editor named UnityPy. For this, I also created some additional libraries to support the export and import of more asset types.
Through this, I learned knowledge in various fields, such as binary formats, encryption, compression, textures, networking, and many more.


Irl I'm a computer science student that focuses on data security and network analysis. In the future I will likely publish some useful tools in those two areas, so stay tuned.

__Tools__
